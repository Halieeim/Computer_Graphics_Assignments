# Computer_Graphics_Assignments

> ### Assignment1 (Line and Circle)
>> This assignment asks you to draw a circle divided into 8 sectors by 8 lines (each line is a radius).
>> So you will need to write two algorithms: one for line, and one for circle. (I used Parametric line algorithm and Polar circle)

> ### Assignment2 (Circle and Curve)
>> This assignment asks you to draw a face (a large circle includes two small circles which represent the eyes) and a curve which represent a smile but if the curve has any points outside the circle then you must color it otherwise color it red.
>> So you will need to impelement an algorithm for circle and algorithm for curve. (I used Polar circle and Hermite curve)
